# ECE387-SYN6288-Interfacing

This project is an implementation of a SYN6288 Speech Synthesis chip to test the functionality of the chip. Included is an Arduino IDE implementation that works and a AVR Implementation that I have not been able to make function. This implementation will spell out my name, "Taylor", and then also spell out "ECE387".

To compile and run the Arduino IDE version, you will need to download the syn6288_test.ino file and open it in the Arduino IDE. You will also need to download the Syn6288.h and Syn6288.cpp files and zip them together to add them to the Arduino IDE as a library. You can then upload and run the program to the COM port corresponding to your Arduino.
